# this is a repo of example HikVision camera control through C and IP media device management protocal under linux system

To use the code the curl library must be install. For ubuntu 16.04, just type in following command to install curl:
sudo apt-get install curl

By following the guide of "IP Media Device Management Protocal User Guide" V2 2013-12, all the funcitons in the guide can be implemented through my code with curl PUT/GET/POST method. 

I haven't try the DELETE method since it is not dangerous for my project at the moment. But it should be feasible following the example here.


!!!!! NOTE: I do NOT guarantee the code will not damage the device although it works for the HikVision device in my project.
